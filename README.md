# Monte Carlo Tree Search for Quantum Circuit Design

In this project we implemented a Monte Carlo Tree Search method in order to find near-optimal quantum ansatz in different problems. In particular, we run experiments on VQE, VQLS and Oracle Approximation.

## All-in-one MCTS
Despite the previous work we used MCTS to find both the stucture of the quantum circuit and the parameters. Then we provided MCTS of a progressive widening technique in order to deal with the continuous action space.
